# Autonomous locomotion for a soft robotic tank
using computer vision（ python &amp; opencv）
locate the chosen color blocks using single camera and determine the distance between the camera and color blocks.
the main goal of the project is to help a soft robot passing several given gates with color signs.

The obstacles for the soft robotic tank are sand field, slopes, gates(100% 80% 60% of the robot width), unstable gate(adhere to the floor by magenatic force)
